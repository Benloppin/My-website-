  <p> I am a highly enthusiastic person, very curious, always willing to learn something new and prove myselft. My years of experience in the architectural sector, and my knowledge in project management, have taught me a be a good team player and to develop my communication and soft skills among others. I like to work in international environments and learn different types of thinking.  </p>
